Given the ubiquity of Machine Learning (ML) systems and their relevance in daily lives, it is important to ensure private and safe handling of data alongside equity in human experience. These considerations have gained considerable interest in recent times under the realm of Trustworthy ML. Speech processing in particular presents a unique set of challenges, given the rich information carried in linguistic and paralinguistic content including speaker trait, interaction and state characteristics including health status. In this workshop on Trustworthy Speech Processing (TSP), we aim to bring together new and experienced researchers working on trustworthy ML and speech processing. We invite novel and relevant submissions from both academic and industrial research groups showcasing theoretical and empirical advancements in TSP.

Topics of interest cover a variety of papers centered on speech processing, including (but not
limited to):
- Differential privacy
- Bias and Fairness
- Federated learning
- Ethics in speech processing
- Model interpretability
- Quantifying & mitigating bias in speech processing
- New datasets, frameworks and benchmarks for TSP
- Discovery and defense against emerging privacy attacks
- Trustworthy ML in applications of speech processing like ASR
